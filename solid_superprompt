<llm_optimization_techniques>
Structured knowledge representation: Organize information in a hierarchical structure with clear categories and subcategories. This helps the LLM to better understand and retrieve relevant information.
Use of consistent formatting: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the superprompt, using markdown or similar lightweight markup for improved readability and parsing.
Explicit context signaling: Use clear markers or tags to denote different types of information (e.g., <code>, <example>, <best_practice>). This helps the LLM understand the nature of the content it's processing.
Chunking information: Break down complex concepts into smaller, digestible pieces. This aids in better comprehension and recall of information.
Repetition of key concepts: Reinforce important ideas by repeating them in different contexts or sections. This helps solidify the LLM's understanding of crucial concepts.
Use of examples: Provide concrete code examples for abstract concepts. LLMs often perform better when they can reference specific implementations.
Comparative analysis: Include comparisons between SolidJS and other frameworks (without using them) to highlight unique features and prevent confusion.
Task-oriented structuring: Frame information in terms of specific tasks or problems to solve, as LLMs often perform better with clear, goal-oriented prompts.
Explicit instruction on output format: Provide clear guidelines on how the LLM should structure its responses (e.g., "Always start with a brief explanation, followed by a code example").
Use of mnemonics or acronyms: Create memorable shortcuts for complex concepts to aid in quick recall and application.
Progressive disclosure: Structure information from basic to advanced, allowing the LLM to build upon foundational knowledge.
Explicit error patterns: Include common mistakes or anti-patterns to avoid, helping the LLM understand not just what to do, but what not to do.
Metacognitive prompts: Include prompts that encourage the LLM to "think about its thinking" (e.g., "Before providing a solution, consider the performance implications").
Use of analogies: Relate SolidJS concepts to widely understood programming paradigms or real-world concepts to enhance understanding.
Explicit linking of concepts: Clearly state relationships between different SolidJS features or concepts to help the LLM build a comprehensive mental model.
Inclusion of decision trees: For complex decisions (e.g., choosing between different SolidJS primitives), provide decision trees to guide the LLM's reasoning process.
Periodic summarization: After each major section, include a brief summary of key points to reinforce learning.
Use of hypothetical scenarios: Present "what-if" scenarios to encourage application of knowledge in various contexts.
Explicit performance metrics: Include specific metrics or benchmarks for performance, giving the LLM concrete targets to aim for in code optimization.
Version-specific information: Clearly label information that is version-specific to prevent outdated advice.
